Appointment Booking with Doctors is a web application designed to facilitate the scheduling of medical appointments. It enables users to easily find and book appointments with healthcare professionals based on their specialties and availability. The platform features an intuitive user interface, allowing for quick sign-up, secure login, and efficient appointment management. Additionally, an Admin Dashboard provides administrators with the tools to manage doctor profiles and oversee appointment scheduling, ensuring a smooth experience for both patients and providers. Built on the MERN stack, this application combines the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to deliver a robust and scalable solution for healthcare appointment management.
